perl todo:

 add real team name in addition to red\blue to graphs for ctf

 insane demo support for non tournament games--Started--refer from demoStats

 improve regexs\parsing  -- in progress by Piano

 bring ktpro stats up to par with pure ctf

 player minutes played ( * left the game) could be seconds for ctf

 ask dew about global recompute possibility (or maybe just per tourney)
 can we keep screenshots if recomputing?

 optimize convertAscii.sed

 cleanup pie chart output.  make piechart filename an actual player member

 ctf line graphs could look better.. currently points are only marked 
 every minute even though we store them per second

 all line graphs could be improved by better configuration of y values.
 just cause 1 player momentarily drops to -1 doesnt mean we need to add a -50 
 tick mark adding a bunch of white space at bottom etc
