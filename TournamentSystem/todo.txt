FIXED
------------------------------------------------
Bug #1: Tourney Stats: sorting by name does not work correctly. 
Bug #2: Remove O from image password? People won't know there are not zeroes. 
Bug #3: Main page resizes slightly if it contains news items

  manage news page should sort so new news is at top?
  not sure what the players on the team pages are being sorted by now, but if no games have been played it should be sorted by player name by default
  same goes for standings..
