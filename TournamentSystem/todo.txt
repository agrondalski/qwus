TO DO LIST:   
------------------------------------------------
*Current*:
  Report Match Page (player stats)
  Report Page integration with mvd stats

  Polls
  Would like a way to know if a column has been updated.  Display number of days since last updated? or something.

  Resize Page (so it looks fine in 1024x, 1280x, etc.)
  Fix CSS

  script (updateToSvn.sh?) to update the website.  features should include creating tarball of current site so that we can revert if something goes wrong.  copying all files over.. and updating dbConnect and any other config files as need be.
 
  when reporting a match a team should be able to add 'commentary'.  this was a feature of the nqr system and worked fairly well.

  improved gameDetails.php page
  map stats

  screenshot upload
  schedule/statistics page should be able to limit by division, week

  schedule page remove games that have already been played ? would improve readability especially later in the season?

*Future*:
  Career Player/Teams Stats
  Weapon Stats
  Auto creation of playoff games/tournament style


Ongoing
------------------------------------------------
Maintain security/privilege checks for added files



FIXED
------------------------------------------------
Bug #1: Tourney Stats: sorting by name does not work correctly. 
Bug #2: Remove O from image password? People won't know there are not zeroes. 
Bug #3: Main page resizes slightly if it contains news items

Match/News/Column Comments

manage news page should sort so new news is at top?
not sure what the players on the team pages are being sorted by now, but if no games have been played it should be sorted by player name by default same goes for standings..
many divide by zero warnings\errors in stats.php
tournaments need to provide link to its news archive
comments link in news is not valid html
