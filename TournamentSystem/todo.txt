TO DO LIST:   
------------------------------------------------
*Current*:
  Report Match Page (player stats) : Add Scores for a game w/o mvd, swap players if player matching wasn't correct
  Polls

  Resize Page (so it looks fine in 1024x, 1280x, etc.)
  Fix CSS

*Future*:
  Career Player/Teams Stats
  Auto creation of playoff games/tournament style
  when reporting a match a team should be able to add 'commentary'.  this was a feature of the nqr system and worked fairly well.
  schedule/statistics page should be able to limit by division, week
  Enhance comment system (paragraphs, etc)


Ongoing
